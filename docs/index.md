# Welcome

{% import 'links.jinja2' as links %}

Welcome to the documentation for my {{ links.repoUrl('ansible-role-vyos') }} {{ links.external('ansible') }} role.

It's goal is to make managing a {{ links.external('vyos') }} router with Ansible easier / more structured.

Feel free to open a {{ links.repoUrl('GitHub issue', 'issues/new/choose') }} if you have any questions.
